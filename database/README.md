# Database
The database is a MySQL database. This folder contains creation scripts and models for the database.
1. JobMatch_Model_Criteria_Version is the expanded version of the database that we might have need for depending on the execution of the rest of the project (WIP)
2. JobMatch_Model_Criterias_As_Attributes_Version is a simplified database that we are starting with where the criterias are fields in the "task" table instead of having their own table.
